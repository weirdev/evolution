## WIP
1. Create harness for learning simple functions
2. Train via only selection one such function
3. Add reward (dopamine) input neuron
4. For now rewards will be 1-1 with actual survival success
5. Train via selection & reward for a different function
  1. Allow organism to produce several predictions, each scored and given as feedback to rewared neuron, before applying selection pressure. Best performing organisms (and thus most rewarded) survive.
6. Validate reward based learning / extrapolation by organism able to predict a function for which it never received selection pressure.
  1. Training exposure to validation function will need to be extremely close to testing exposure given "memory" only exists in neuron activation


## Future
Output neurons that can specify neuron / edge formation or deletion.
Negative selection pressure on neuron / edge count.
