# Evolution sim

Idea: Evolve strategies for solving particular problems

Potential problems:
    Regression task
    Image classification

Next steps:
    Build a tunable decision function from each orgs gene sequece
        Decision quality under selection
    Second function from gene sequence
        This tunes the first function during org's life
        Represents learning
        Will need environmental inputs for learning
        Possibly add ability to tune self
    Multi-layer NNs from the above
        Initial weights from evol, then learning
    Learning driven evolution
        Sexual selection
            Same as nature
        Possibly add ability for org to learn and select genes to pass down and mutation rates
            Probably no natural analog, although epigenetics may drive somewhat similar processes

Future Ideas:
    Sexual selection
        Place sexual metrics under natural selection as well
